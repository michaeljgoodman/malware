## Obfuscation
This sample is lightly obfuscated. When including explicit strings pointing to chrome files, VirusTotal flagged "Windows ML" as detecting trojan behaviour.
Constructing the string through concatenation did not stop this same engine from detecting the same flag.
Made use of a simple rot13 encoding of the strings and this managed to evade detection.

Additionally, the string is then not searchable by yara rules or simple string searching. However, it is very clear to a technical user that this is some form of simple shifted file path, due to rot13 only shifting alphabetical characters, and not special characters such as ':' or '\'
